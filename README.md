## React js Countdown Timer

As with everybody else, I wanted to make sure I was being as proficient as possible with my study of React. I looked up Pomodoro timer but wanted to go deeper. I found a few different timer schedules that others had recommended and gave three of them a try. I tried the classic 25/5 min method, 90/120 min method and the 52/17 min method.

### My Inspiration

Some of the research I conducted led me to [Lifehacker](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/08/52-minute-work-17-minute-break-is-the-ideal-productivity-schedule/) and [freelancing hacks](https://freelancinghacks.com/how-why-use-the-5217-rule-for-productivity/).<br />

I found for myself that 25 min was not long enough. I was just getting warmed up as the timer ticked to zero & the 90 min was too long. The perfect timer for me was the 52/17 min timer. So I had my timer now to make a cool app out of it to make my life easier and a bit of fun.

### Problems that I ran into

I had tried this before but I had used setInterval and after testing and more research found out this was the wrong way to go about it as the count was off. With this version, I used Date with setInterval. It is actually on time now. So thatâ€™s a plus.<br />

I came undone when I tried to get the gif in the background to sit nice. A quick web search found some awesome documentation. I use the same site for other CSS hints but the CSS Tricks site is awesome. A very handy resource. [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/)

### Version 1 complete

I have a version that works and I am going to use for a while to test it out and make notes on how to improve it. I have a few ideas but want to use it for a week first just to make sure.
